                I'm a <strong>full-stack software engineer</strong> who is an eager learner and a passionate problem solver.
                Since being accepted to Code in Place in 2020, I have fallen in love with the process of coding -- everything from breaking down problems, to debugging code and finally seeing how everything comes together.
                Iâ€™m excited to explore all that this field has to offer and continue growing as a software engineer.
